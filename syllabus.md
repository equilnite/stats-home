## Introduction

AP Statistics is an introductory course to the *traditional* concepts and tools for collecting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. In this modern world driven by data, an understanding of data representations and decrypting others’ analyses of data become ever more important.

These concepts and tools can be used to investigate questions such as:

- Does the death penalty prevent murders from occurring?
- How do voters feel about a current ballot issue or presidential candidates?
- How effective is a new treatment for patients with AIDS?
- Do students in smaller classes learn more than those in larger classes?
- To what extent are humans causing global warming?
- Do children who are exposed to lead (in paint, etc.) become more violent?
- Do abstinence education programs cause teens to have sex less frequently?
- Do students who get placed in their program of choice at BHS perform better than those who don’t?
- Does smoking marijuana cause memory loss?

### OUTLINE OF COURSE OBJECTIVES AND TOPICS: 

Here are the topics you should expect to cover by quarter.

- Quarter 1: Chapters 1, 4, 2 (Exploring Data, Designing Studies, and Modeling Distributions of Data)
- Quarter 2: Chapters 5, 6, and 7 (Probability, Random Variables, Sampling Distributions)
- Quarter 3: Chapters 8, 9, and 10 (Confidence Intervals, Hypothesis Tests, Inference for Two Populations)
- Quarter 4: Chapters 11, 3, and 12 (Distributions of Categorical Data, Linear Regression)

### MATERIALS NEEDED

1.	**A graphing calculator** (TI-83, TI-84, or TI-84 Plus are recommended) will be needed for work throughout the year. 
    a.	It’s recommended that you get one for yourself. Second-hand calculators are very easy and cheap to find (Facebook Marketplace, eBay, etc.)
    b.	You can also check out a graphing calculator from the library.
2.	**Textbook**: *The Practice of Statistics*, 5th edition (Starnes, Tabor, Yates, Moore 2014)
3.	During class, packets will be provided for you to write and take notes on. If you lose a packet, please email me so that I have a copy for you the next day. It is your own responsibility to have it on you at all times during class.
    If you are not responsible with these materials, you will be at a disadvantage.

### RESOURCES

- **DO NOT USE GOOGLE FOR EVERYTHING, especially depending on AI**. There are many ways to do statistics, and *you are learning a specific way to do statistics* by being in this class.
- **Your textbook is your main resource**. Things that you find on the internet, unless specifically geared towards AP Statistics, may not be the correct way to do it.
- I will regularly update [stats-notes.echa.ng] with notes from each topic that we encounter.
- Students in the past have found office hours and Khan Academy really helpful
 
 
## GRADES

Grades will be assigned on a traditional scale:

**A**: ≥ 90%	

**B**: ≥ 80%	

**C**: ≥ 70%	

**D**: ≥ 60%	

**F**: < 60%

### Components

**Homework and Classwork: 30%**

> Homework: Assigned from back of packet; problems due after the completion of each packet.
>
> Classwork: Checks for work assigned for class time and random packet checks for completion of notes.
>
> It is your responsibility to monitor the scores put in Infinite Campus. If you miss the day of a packet check or work, you are expected to email / talk to Chang immediately and show her the relevant completed pages in the packet.

**Quizzes: 15%**

> At most one quiz a week, based on skills from classwork. The worst quiz will be dropped from your grade per semester.

**Tests: 35%**

> One test per chapter, for a total of twelve tests within eight months. The single worst test will be dropped from your grade per semester.

**Semester Exam: 20%**

> A cumulative exam of the material covered over the semester. 
Are there “extra” assignments?
>
> There are no extra assignments for you to do to make up a grade or to raise your grade.


### Keep up in class

The *amount of content* in this course makes this course as *challenging* as taking Calculus. You may find Calculus harder because of your Algebra skills, but that is the main barrier for Calculus. Although AP Statistics is more accessible, it does not mean that it is easier than Calculus. 

**Whether one course is more challenging than the other depends on the person!**

Unlike your previous math classes, this course places a high emphasis on your ability to think logically and critically, and express that thinking clearly in writing. It is also a course that builds on itself chapter by chapter. **It is dangerous to fall behind by even two days.**

### Extra credit opportunities

From time to time, there will be challenge problems on tests for extra credit that challenge you to apply your understanding.

## ASSESSMENT POLICY

The assessments will hold you up to the expectation of skill mastery that the AP exam also holds you up to.

The AP exam consists of:
- 40 Multiple Choice Questions for 90 minutes (2.25 minutes per question)
- 6 Free Response Questions for 90 minutes (15 minutes per question)

**The typical “passing” percentage on the AP exam is around 45%.**
Therefore, you should expect for scores in this class to be centered around that same passing percentage. 

*To avoid people failing because of their raw score, assessment scores (i.e. tests and semester exam) will be adjusted accordingly so that around 30% or more students receive a 90% or higher on the assessment.*

All assessments and their respective re-take will be announced at least 2 weeks in advance.

You are expected to make up any missed tests at the soonest possible moment. Chang has the obligation to release test results as soon as possible and you will receive a zero if you fail to take the test in a timely manner.

### Accommodations:

Extended time: You may continue your test in H206 during lunch (the day of).

No extended time will be given because of tardiness and these deadlines will be enforced strictly. 

### Retakes

All retakes will be designated to be taken after school.
1. You can retake up to 2 tests per semester (total of 6 tests are administered per semester).
2. Retake request forms are physical and must be signed by your parent/guardian and your parent/guardian may be contacted to confirm that you have told them.
3. If you do not turn in the form by the deadline as indicated, you will not get a retake.
4. You must take the retake within 2 school days of the first day of the retake.
5. No last minute asks.

If you miss an opportunity for assessment / reassessment completely, you will keep the current grade that you have on it in the gradebook.

## A PARTING THOUGHT

Grades and penalties aren’t the purpose of this course. I really just want you to learn. I want all of you to be successful here. 

AP Statistics is a college level course and this long syllabus and its policies are here to make it so that you understand that. If you weren’t ready for these strict rules, you should seek me out for help as soon as you see yourself slipping off. 

If you fall behind, you will likely not recover in this class. I promise that if you put the effort and attention into this class during lessons, you will get a grade that you are satisfied with. 

The concepts that we encounter will be tough to understand on your own, but by doing the work that I assign, you will understand it so much better than just copying down answers and trying to follow a calculation that I did on the board.

## Changes to policies

Depending on circumstances, Chang may make logistical policy changes to facilitate the pacing of the course. Nothing will change with the grading scale.
 
## PARENTS/GUARDIANS: 

As a way of establishing communication early in the school year, I’ve required students to go over this syllabus in detail with you and have you contact me to inform me that you have reviewed this information with your student. 

Please use the contact information at the top of this syllabus. Having your contact information will allow me to easily get in touch with you if I have any concerns about your student. 

For your child to earn full credit, they should ensure that you include their name and period as the subject of the email. Please include the following information:

1.	Your child's name and period (as the subject of the email, please)
2.	Your name (It's not always clear from an email address!)
3.	A phone number where you can be reached and the best times to call, and preferred means of contact.
4.	Any contact information for another parent/guardian.
5.	Tell me something awesome about your child!
6.	Any additional information that you feel is relevant or important.
7.	If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to mention them when you contact me. I’m happy to hear your input or give you feedback at any time.
