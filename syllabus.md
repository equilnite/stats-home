## Contact me

Email me at `edwardchang@berkeley.net` with any concerns that you have. I will try to reply ASAP during working hours.

As mentioned below, you should proactively email me so that you can:
1. Have anything that you lost the next day
2. Making appointments for taking a test in which you missed the entire day of school for.
3. Any appointments that that you need for something during lunch time.

## Materials Needed

*If you are not responsible with these materials, you will be at a disadvantage.*

1. Textbook: *The Practice of Statistics, 5th edition* (Starnes, Tabor, Yates, Moore 2014)
    - For practice, you should plan to bring your textbook to class. There will be no textbooks in the classroom for you to borrow from me. 
2. During class, **packets** will be provided for you to write and take notes on. If you lose a packet, please **email me so that I have a copy for you the next day**. It is your own responsibility to have it on you at all times during class.
3. **A graphing calculator** (*TI-83, TI-84, or TI-84 Plus are recommended*) will be essential for work in the 4th quarter and recommended doing calculations in the 2nd and 3rd quarter. People taking the AP exam need one. If you’re on a budget, you can acquire one by:
    - checking one out from the library 
    - looking on Craigslist or eBay to see if you can find a cheaper used one


## Office Hours and Appointments

The exact days and availability of office hours will be known later. 

Due to my room assignments, I may not have any office hours.

I am happy to take any appointments during lunch as long as you *email me the previous day*.

### Mr. Mah's Office Hours

Mr. Mah will have regular office hours... TBD.

## Grades

Things that you will not be graded on are: homework, participation, behavior, warm-ups. When you have a hobby, you put in the time and effort to make you better at that hobby...school work should be the same. All these things are practice, active learning. In every unit you should ask yourself - **do you know the standard we are learning?** 

**I use standards-based grading on a 4.0 scale. All assessments or rubrics will be graded on this scale. The correspondence to these grades are as follows:**

| Numerical Score | Letter Grade | Meaning | Standard Description |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| 4 | A | Exceeding Standard | Able to do challenge problems, has especially good explanations, or can teach it |
| 3 | B | Meeting Standard | Consistently shows understanding of standard. There may be small mistakes that don’t demonstrate a lack of understanding |
| 2 | C | Approaching Standard | Shows understanding of part, but not all of the standard |
| 1 | D | Beginning Standard | Attempted assignment, but was not able to show understanding of the standard |
| 0 | F | Insufficient Evidence | Assessments not submitted or attempted - I don’t know if you can do it or not |

### Grading Scale

**A**: ≥ 85%

**B**: ≥ 70%

**C**: ≥ 50%

**D**: ≥ 30%

**F**: < 30%


### What is graded?

You will have at least 2 chances to meet each standard. Things that may be graded will be: exit tickets, projects, quizzes/**tests**, and presentations. Every time something is going to be an opportunity to show you’ve met a standard I will EXPLICITLY tell you that the assessment is being graded. 

### Keep up in class

PLEASE advocate for yourself and get as much help as you need. I will likely not be available for regular office hours but am happy to arrange a meeting by appointment during lunch. Not much prior mathematical knowledge is required for success in this course, but it is a very challenging course that places high emphasis on your **ability to think logically and critically**, and express that thinking clearly in writing. It is also a course that **builds on itself** even more than most math classes, so staying current with your homework, and being consistent with your effort in general, is extremely important. If you don't keep up in class, you will struggle with future material.

### Extra credit opportunities

From time to time, there will be challenge problems on tests for extra credit that challenge you to apply your understanding.

Also, we will have extra standards (not extra credit) where your grade will be bumped up for paying attention and being on task during class. These will likely happen at the end of each semester.

### Are there "extra" assignments?

No, there will not be any extra assignments because you missed out on an assessment, did not follow along in class, or did not study enough throughout the semester. 

If you run into any verifiable sickness or other situation that prevents you from doing your best, then we can talk about other ways for you to catch up.

## Assessment Policy

All assessments and their respective re-take will be announced at least 2 weeks in advance. 

1. Missing the period of the test:
    - If you miss the period of the test but are present in school, you may come in afterschool (the day of) to {{ site.room }} to take the test.
    - If you miss the entire day, **first email me ASAP** (otherwise, I will not be expecting you) and you have only until the next school day to take it in {{ site.room }}.

2. Accommodations:
    - Extended time: You may continue your test in {{ site.room }} afterschool (the day of).

When it’s time for a retake, a Google Form will be posted on classroom. If you do not fill out the form by the deadline as indicated, you will not get a retake. **If you sign-up for the retake and decide to never take it, you will not be allowed to take the next re-take.**

No extended time will be given because of **tardiness and these deadlines will be enforced strictly**. If you miss an opportunity for assessment/reassessment completely, **you will keep the current grade that you have on that standard** (*including any 0's because you forgot to take a test or fill out a form*)
