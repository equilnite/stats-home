## Perserverence

You should not be giving up on any problem during class. All problems are things that you should be at least able to answer with the information given to you.

If you are having trouble getting started, ask yourself:
- "What does this question mean?"
- "Where am I supposed to find the information for this problem?"

You can also reach out to your group mates on how they started off the problems.

Strive for:
- **Positive Attitude**: Approach problems with a positive mindset. Believe in your ability to overcome challenges and view them as opportunities to learn and grow.
- **Break Problems Down**: Divide complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks. Focus on solving one part at a time, which can make the overall problem seem less overwhelming.
- **Use Available Resources**: Utilize textbooks, class notes, online resources, and other reference materials to understand concepts and find examples related to the problem you're facing. But be aware that **Google is not going to help you understand everything** you need for this specific class; there are tons of different ways to write things in statistics and if it is not how we do it in class, you are not learning the right thing.
- **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to ask questions in class or seek help from your teacher, classmates, or online communities. Engaging in discussions can provide new perspectives and insights.
- **Seek Feedback**: After attempting a problem, seek feedback on your solution. Understanding your mistakes and learning from them is a crucial part of the problem-solving process.
- **Persevere Through Challenges**: Don't be discouraged by initial failures. Persevere through challenges, learn from your mistakes, and keep trying different approaches until you find a solution.
- **Self-Reflection**: Reflect on your problem-solving process. Identify what strategies work best for you and adapt your approach based on your strengths and weaknesses.

## Collaboration

Your groupmates are there for a reason and you have groupmates for a reason.

Ask your groupmates what they know that can help you.

And if your groupmates ask you something, try your best to help them.

Asking and answering are both ways to learn!

Strive for:
- **Respectful Communication**: Group members should listen actively and respectfully to each other, valuing diverse opinions and perspectives.
- **Problem-Solving**: Encourage a problem-solving mindset within the group. Discuss challenges openly and work together to find solutions.
- **Peer Support**: Be supportive of fellow group members. Offer help and guidance when someone is struggling with a concept or task.
- **Feedback**: Provide constructive feedback to one another. It helps in improving the overall group performance and learning experience.
- **Understanding**: Ensure that every group member understands the concepts being discussed. Help each other grasp difficult topics and clarify doubts.
