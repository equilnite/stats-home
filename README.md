# AP Statistics with Mr. Chang

WELCOME to AP Statistics, an introductory course to the concepts and tools for collecting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. In this modern world driven by data, an understanding of data representations and data usage become ever more significant.

These concepts and tools can be used to investigate questions such as:

- Does the death penalty prevent murders from occurring?
- How do voters feel about a current ballot issue or presidential candidate?
- How effective is a new treatment for patients with AIDS?
- Do students in smaller classes learn more than those in larger classes?
- To what extent are humans causing global warming?
- Do children who are exposed to lead (in paint, etc) become more violent?
- Do abstinence education programs cause teens to have sex less frequently?
- Do students who get placed in their program of choice at BHS perform better than those who donâ€™t?
- Does smoking marijuana cause memory loss?
