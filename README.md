# AP Statistics with Mr. Chang

WELCOME to AP Statistics, an introductory course to the *traditional* statistical concepts and tools for collecting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data along with their probabalistic underpinnings. In this modern world driven by data, an understanding of data representations and data usage become ever more significant.

These concepts and tools can be used to investigate questions such as:

- Does the death penalty prevent murders from occurring?
- How do voters feel about a current ballot issue or presidential candidate?
- How effective is a new treatment for patients with AIDS?
- Do students in smaller classes learn more than those in larger classes?
- To what extent are humans causing global warming?
- Do children who are exposed to lead (in paint, etc) become more violent?
- Do abstinence education programs cause teens to have sex less frequently?
- Do students who get placed in their program of choice at BHS perform better than those who donâ€™t?
- Does smoking marijuana cause memory loss?

Or simpler questions such as:

- Is gambling worth it?
- Has a game been rigged?
- Has a sports team's performance changed?

## Resources


DO NOT USE GOOGLE FOR EVERYTHING. There are many ways to do statistics, and you are learning a specific way to do that. 

Your textbook is your main resource. Things that you find on the internet, unless specifically geared towards AP Statistics, may not be the correct way to do it. There are many ways to do statistics, and AP Statistics is looking for a specific approach.
