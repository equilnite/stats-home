# AP Statistics with Chang

AP Statistics is an introductory course to the *traditional* concepts and tools for collecting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. In this modern world driven by data, an understanding of data representations and decrypting others’ analyses of data become ever more important.

These concepts and tools can be used to investigate questions such as:

- Does the death penalty prevent murders from occurring?
- How do voters feel about a current ballot issue or presidential candidates?
- How effective is a new treatment for patients with AIDS?
- Do students in smaller classes learn more than those in larger classes?
- To what extent are humans causing global warming?
- Do children who are exposed to lead (in paint, etc.) become more violent?
- Do abstinence education programs cause teens to have sex less frequently?
- Do students who get placed in their program of choice at BHS perform better than those who don’t?
- Does smoking marijuana cause memory loss?

Or simpler questions such as:

- Is gambling worth it?
- Has a game been rigged?
- Has a sports team's performance changed?

## Outline and Topics

Here are the topics you should expect to cover by quarter.

- Quarter 1: Chapters 1, 4, 2 (Exploring Data, Designing Studies, and Modeling Distributions of Data)
- Quarter 2: Chapters 5, 6, and 7 (Probability, Random Variables, Sampling Distributions)
- Quarter 3: Chapters 8, 9, and 10 (Confidence Intervals, Hypothesis Tests, Inference for Two Populations)
- Quarter 4: Chapters 11, 3, and 12 (Distributions of Categorical Data, Linear Regression)

## Resources

- **DO NOT USE GOOGLE FOR EVERYTHING, especially depending on AI**. There are many ways to do statistics, and *you are learning a specific way to do statistics* by being in this class.
- **Your textbook is your main resource**. Things that you find on the internet, unless specifically geared towards AP Statistics, may not be the correct way to do it.
- I will regularly update [stats-notes.echa.ng] with notes from each topic that we encounter.
- Students in the past have found office hours and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics?authuser=0) really helpful
