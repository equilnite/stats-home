Hello everyone! Hope you're ready for this upcoming school year. I'm looking forward to meeting you all. Before we get started, I need everyone to prepare themselves for this course. AP Statistics was recommended for a lot of you, and even though you may not need *as much* math knowledge as the other senior year math courses, it is an intensive course with many new ideas. By taking this course, you'll be committing yourself to learning these new concepts and keeping on track with them. 

There is always a handful of students who do not have that commitment and find themselves completely lost by the second semester and worry about being rescinded by their college. To do well in this course, you need to be ready to do work in the course from the beginning of this school year and most of the second semester.

But anyways, please acquaint yourselves with this website, namely the [homepage](/) and the [syllabus](/syllabus/) for now. Keep in mind that the planned chapterly schedule will always be posted on the [calendar](/calendar/)

Also, please complete the [Student Info Form](https://forms.gle/NHTwgVpv53Ssyxq56) whenever you have the time. It includes questions on why you chose this course and letting me know of how I should address you in class.
