## ***SP1***{: .label .label-yellow} Attend to statistical precision.

Statistically proficient students make sense of problems and strive to convey the meaning and context of their answers to a general audience. They approach problems from a scientific standpoint, understanding the problem and:

- Context: Consider the context of the data and problem, ensuring their conclusions are relevant and appropriately framed.
- Vocabulary: Use precise and appropriate statistical vocabulary to clearly communicate their findings and reasoning.

## ***SP2***{: .label .label-yellow} Attend to mathematical precision.

Statistically proficient students attend to the correctness of their mathematical work, considering context of a problem. They:

- Correctness: Ensure their mathematical and statistical work is accurate, checking for errors and validating results.
- Calculations: Perform calculations meticulously, verifying each step to maintain accuracy and reliability in their statistical analyses.

## ***SP3***{: .label .label-yellow} Select, construct, and critique data representations.

Statistically proficient students can select, construct, and critique data representations. They:

- Appropriate Representations: Choose the most appropriate tables, graphs, labels, scaling, and values to represent data accurately.
- Misleading Graphs: Identify and critique misleading graphs, ensuring that their representations of data are honest and transparent.

## ***SP4***{: .label .label-yellow} Describe and compare distributions of data and describe relationships between variables.

Statistically proficient students describe and compare distributions of data and analyze relationships between variables. They:

- Choosing Measures: Decide when to use median, mean, or other measures of central tendency based on the data's characteristics.
- Analyze distributions: Use criteria such as SOVC and SFDO to describe graphs.
- Relationships: Describe and interpret relationships between variables, identifying trends, correlations, and potential causal relationships.

## ***SP5***{: .label .label-yellow} Describe and perform methods for studies and inferential statistics.

Statistically proficient students can describe and perform methods for studies and inferential statistics. They:

- Experiments/Sampling: Design and describe experiments and sampling methods, ensuring methodological soundness and ethical considerations.
- Procedural Fluency: Demonstrate procedural fluency in the four-step process of inference: State, Plan, Do, and Conclude


## ***SP6***{: .label .label-yellow} Explain, critique, and compare methods for descriptive and inferential statistics.

Statistically proficient students explain, critique, and compare methods for descriptive and inferential statistics. They:

- Sampling Designs: Evaluate different sampling designs, recognizing strengths and limitations.
- Experiment Designs: Critique experiment designs, ensuring they are robust and free from bias.
- Scope of Inference: Understand and articulate the scope of inference, acknowledging the limitations of generalizability.
- Inference Procedures: Select appropriate inference procedures for different contexts and data types.
- Interpretations: Interpret results accurately, considering the implications and potential errors in their analyses.
- Errors: Identify and understand types of errors (Type I and Type II) in statistical inference and their consequences.
